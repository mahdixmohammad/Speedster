The video's playback speed can only be modified to be between 0 - 16 due to browser limitations. 
The following are the available features that you can use to adjust the speed:
-  Click any of the preset speed buttons (which can be customized).
-  Manually type in the desired speed in the centered input box located underneath the preset speed buttons.
-  Use the single arrow buttons beside the input box to change the speed by 0.10 (left decreases by 0.10, right increases by 0.10).
-  Use the double arrow buttons beside the single arrows to change the speed by 1.00 (left decreases by 1.00, right increases by 1.00).
-  While the extension popup is open, pressing the 1 through 9 keys on your keyboard allows you to quickly switch between presets.
-  While outside the extension popup, pressing the "Alt" key plus 1 through 9 keys on your keyboard allows you to quickly switch between presets.
-  The toggle keybinds button enables / disables whether you want to able to switch through presets using your keyboard.
-  The toggle extension button enables / disables the extension and hence resets the playback speed to 1.00.
-  The pencil icon allows you to edit all the preset speed buttons and save them in the extension. Simply click the icon and then click on any of 
the buttons to type in a new speed.
-  The reset icon resets the extension (including the speed and presets) to default.
